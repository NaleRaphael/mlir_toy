## Note
- We need to add `mlir::LLVM:createRequestCWrappersPass()` to the pass pipeline
  to make functions able to be invoked via execution engine's C-API.
  This pass will attach `llvm.emit_c_interface` attribute to each function,
  which will generate wrappers prefixed with `_mlir_ciface_`. So that when
  we call `mlirExecutionEngineInvokePacked()`, it would not fail for finding
  the specific function. See also links below for details:
  - [How `mlirExecutionEngineInvokePacked()` works][1]
  - [Definition of `createRequestCWrappersPass()`][2]
